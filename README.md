# Running the application
A window will open up, allowing you to input grades and weights. You can add additional fields for grades and weights using the "Add grade" button. When you are ready to calculate the average, click the "Calculate" button. The calculated average will be displayed at the bottom of the window.

To reset the application and clear all of the input fields, click the "Clear" button.

# Customizing the application

You can customize the behavior of the application by modifying the code in the script. For example, you can change the layout and appearance of the GUI by modifying the Tkinter code in the script.
