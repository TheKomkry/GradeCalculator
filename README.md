# Grade Calculator

This is a simple GUI application built using the Tkinter library in Python that allows a user to input grades and their respective weights and calculates the weighted average of those grades.

## Running the application

To run the application, first make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/grade-calculator.git
cd grade-calculator
```
Run the script using Python:
```python
python grade_calculator.py
```

A window will open up, allowing you to input grades and weights. You can add additional fields for grades and weights using the "Add grade" button. When you are ready to calculate the average, click the "Calculate" button. The calculated average will be displayed at the bottom of the window.

To reset the application and clear all of the input fields, click the "Clear" button.

## Customizing the application

You can customize the behavior of the application by modifying the code in the script. For example, you can change the default values for the grades and weights that are prompted for in the console by modifying the getGrades function. You can also change the layout and appearance of the GUI by modifying the Tkinter code in the script.
